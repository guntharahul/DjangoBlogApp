add ip address in settings.py and nginx server.




sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-availabe/djangoproject  /etc/nginx/sites-enabled  -----> to enable the code written in nginx setup file.
sudo nginx -t ----->check nginx setup.

if there is something wrong just restart the nginx server.


do this when you start a VM if server is not running

service gunicorn restart
sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo systemctl status gunicorn.service
